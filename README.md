# Marcus Young Portfolio Website

## Summary

This website is designed to showcase my previous projects that *totally* work. It contains 3 sections: an about me page with a brief personal summary, a contact page, and the main porfolio page with links to my previous projects.
To achieve this I used:

### HTML
Used to create the ugly but functional skeleton page with pictures but without any styling

### CSS
Used to format and add styles to the page to spice things up such as fonts, spacing, and color.

## Challenges
All of the HTML was super straigtforward, although it did feel a little weird following the best practice of doing most of the HTML before doing any CSS for each section. I constantly felt the urge to just style each tag after putting them in, but it's definitely a good thing that I didn't.
Most of the CSS was fine. The biggest problem for me was that I only learned about the grid method the day after I formatted and placed everything. I literally spent 3 hours on the nav bar intermittently yelling at my screen because floats are frustrating.

## Feedback
If there are any suggestions for my website or ideas for future projects to include in my portfolio, let me know in the contact me page.

## Disclaimer
Please be warned if for some reason you have something against the color green. I added a slightly obnoxious background that flaunts the fact that green is my favorite color, but it's my portfolio page so be aware of that and deal with it. Thanks!
